# Bacteria-Biodiversity-Visualizations

This repository contains code that will create a website with interactive visualizations of data from the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). The data used to create these visualizations is sourced from this [json file](https://github.com/wawilson810/interactive-web-visualizations-challenge/blob/main/samples.json) and is read into a [javascript file](https://github.com/wawilson810/interactive-web-visualizations-challenge/blob/main/static/js/app.js) which is being run in the [html](https://github.com/wawilson810/interactive-web-visualizations-challenge/blob/main/index.html). The visualizations that are created are a chart of the metadata for the test subject, a bar plot that shows counts of the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, and a bubble chart showing all of the OTUs found as well as their count. The interactive component of this webpage is the fact that users will be able to toggle through the different test subjects using a dropdown menu.
